# Real-time Map Feedback for Coordinated Image Sampling

This repository hosts the source code for the project webpage, showcasing the paper "Impact of Real-time Map Feedback on Coordinated Image Sampling for 3D Reconstruction" by Muhammad Hanif, Takumi Sumino, Kuniaki Uto, Daisuke Ichihashi, Kelvin Cheng, and Takeshi Hatanaka.

You can view the website [here](https://mhd-hanif.github.io).

## About the Project

This webpage highlights our work on enhancing coverage control using real-time map feedback, integrating angle-aware coverage with real-time map feedback from [NeuralRecon](https://zju3dv.github.io/neuralrecon/). Our method leverages this feedback for improved 3D reconstruction and control using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
